# Curve fitting
...Jupyter notebook code to demonstrate curve fitting in Python with [scipy.optimize's curve_fit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html), code used to generate plots for a screencast / lecture [demonstrating curve fitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl-Ye38qkRc) (posted on YouTube).

Code:

- `curve_fit_example.ipynb` contains example code to fit a line or a parabola to a generated data set.
- `scratch_work_for_slides.ipynb` contains much the same code, not as well-documented, more just scratch work
